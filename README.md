# linux-scripts
Assorted scripts I find useful that I place in ```~/bin```

```./dirs``` is a directory which contains sub-directories for software that are not installed system wide. Things like my own private Eclipse builds.
```./links``` is a directory which contains symlinks to binaries, mostly they are going to be in ```./dirs``` but not necessarily. Add ```~/bin``` and ```~/bin/links``` to your ```$PATH``` environment variable, then fill your links
directory with links to the application binaries in ```./dirs```.
